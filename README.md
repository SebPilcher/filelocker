# filelocker
A basic file encrypting/decrypting program written in python.
Now uses CBC-mode encryption.
If you want to encrypt a folder, compress it into a .zip file to encrypt it.

Do not use this program for anything other than testing. It is not perfect and can/will probably break somehow.

Written on python 3.11.2
